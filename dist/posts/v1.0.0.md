V1 has both devolved and evolved from V0:
- Devolved in the sense that it's now just a static site, and not a cms or anything fancy
- Evolved in the sense that it's now a static site, and not a cms or anything fancy

Making it static has made it alot easier to decentralize it, which was my main goal.
Scaling down the ambition of the project's versioning feature sets and CMS features has made it easier to focus on why I wanted to build this in the first place: to have a place to write.

The thing you're reading is just a simple markdown file hosted on IPFS through a service called
[fleek](https://fleek.xyz/). I'm rendering it with a simple WASM markdown renderer in Rust.
And because everything is pointed at by a root CID, I can update and link to content that's hosted with the same root CID. Here's an something I drew once:

Maintenance for this project has moved [to this repository](https://github.com/amiller68/krondor-rs).

Hope you like it have fun check back soon
